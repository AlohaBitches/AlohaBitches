                <a href="#item1"><h1>Evio</h1></a>
                <p>
                    Shocker! EVIO IS REAL XOXO I mean... no one expected this but it's definetely iconic. For those who live under a rock Evio = Eva x Antonio. <a href="https://vine.co/v/hhA1p6T6LTl"><u><strong>Uy cowboy girl I love you.</strong></u></a>

                <a href="#item2"><h1>Irakliy Joins the equation</h1></a>
                <p>
                    <strong>NO WAY!!</strong> It seems like eva had an affair with Irakliy when Antonio was gone! We knew that Eva had a thing for him in the past but... that was  a dick move eva... How will Antonio react??
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="item3">
                <a href="#item3"><h1>The Reaction</h1></a>
                <p>
                    Ironic. It seems like our source of information wasn't completely precise. Yes, eva had an affair. She's a cheater. However, it wasn't with Irakliy... It was with <strong>Ms. Metcalf!</strong> We understand how the confusion arose xoxo Thousands of testimonials suggest that Antonio has declared himself gay... The irony just keeps increasing... <p> Additionally, Adriana and Antonio had twincest under the table, Mencia and Eva joined. This information is 100% real as one of our main sources assures they witnessed everything xoxo </p>

However, we have new gossip xoxo and it's the greatest gossip you will hear today... <strong> and I ain't kidding.</strong> I know that you Bitches don't like to read long-ass paragraphs so I'll just announce the gossip straight away: Rosie has a rotten pussy and Eva üòçlovesüòç to suck on it. Yeah, I know it isn't as impressive as you expected but it's called clickbait bitches xoxo

                <p style="color:red">
			Finally, the gossip must be <strong>revealed</strong> xoxo. Julia told the public she was going to Italy. Isn't that right? We recall that she mentioned that she would be staying there until the 8th. Well, for now, we can only reveal that - undoubtedly - she has been lying to us. In 1 hour <strong> EVERYTHING WILL BE REVEALED </strong>
