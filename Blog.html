                <a href="#item1"><h1>Evio</h1></a>
                <p>
                    Shocker! EVIO IS REAL XOXO I mean... no one expected this but it's definetely iconic. For those who live under a rock Evio = Eva x Antonio. <a href="https://vine.co/v/hhA1p6T6LTl"><u><strong>Uy cowboy girl I love you.</strong></u></a>

                <a href="#item2"><h1>Irakliy Joins the equation</h1></a>
                <p>
                    <strong>NO WAY!!</strong> It seems like eva had an affair with Irakliy when Antonio was gone! We knew that Eva had a thing for him in the past but... that was  a dick move eva... How will Antonio react??

            <section id="item3">
                <a href="#item3"><h1>The Reaction</h1></a>
                <p>
                    Ironic. It seems like our source of information wasn't completely precise. Yes, eva had an affair. She's a cheater. However, it wasn't with Irakliy... It was with <strong>Ms. Metcalf!</strong> We understand how the confusion arose xoxo Thousands of testimonials suggest that Antonio has declared himself gay... The irony just keeps increasing...
